Hi I'm Jack Fukushima! I'm in the MD/PhD program in the social sciences here in my first year of grad school. I studied public health and global poverty and practice at UC Berkeley, and worked for three years on projects related to global health equity, abolition, and COVID testing and vaccination. While in med school, I've been inspired by the harm reduction activists and organizations in LA and the constant organizing to provide actually good, affordable housing. I work for one of these organizations providing transportation for people to their methadone clinics, and I'm hoping I can learn skills in this course that can help me and others in this community better understand the spatial relationships at play when it comes to people navigating the landscape of medication assisted treatment.
